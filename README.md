Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders (clients, end-users, and others) are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It involves understanding what a software system should do rather than how it should do it.

The goal is to produce a clear, comprehensive, and agreed-upon requirement specification document that acts as a foundation for all future development phases.
